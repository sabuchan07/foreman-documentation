= Creating a Backup of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on {RHEL} 7

Before you perform a fresh installation of the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on the {RHEL} 8 system, back up your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} data on the {RHEL} 7 system by creating an offline backup.

If you recently created an offline backup, you can perform an incremental backup to update the existing backup.

.Procedure
* Perform an offline or incremental backup on the source machine:
** To perform an offline backup, see xref:backing-up-server-and-proxy[Backing Up Server and Proxy].
** To perform an incremental backup, see xref:performing-an-incremental-backup[Performing an Incremental Backup].
