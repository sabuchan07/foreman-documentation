= Creating a backup of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on {RHEL} 7

Before you perform a fresh installation of the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on the {RHEL} 8 system, back up your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} data on the {RHEL} 7 system by creating an offline backup.

If you recently created an offline backup, you can perform an incremental backup to update the existing backup.

.Procedure
* Perform an offline or incremental backup on the source machine:
** To perform an offline backup, see {AdministeringDocURL}:Administering_Project/{Backing_Up_Server_and_Proxy}.
** To perform an incremental backup, see {AdministeringDocURL}:Administering_Project/{Performing-an-Incremental-Backup}.
* Transfer the backup to the target machine.
