= Converting a Client to Pull-based Transport

.Procedure
Use the following procedure to convert your client to pull-based transport.

. To install your conversion tool, run

----
yum install katello-pull-transport-migrate
----
This also installs `foreman_ygg_worker` and `yggdrasil` as dependencies and performs the conversion.
// Start this list from 2.
[start=2]
. To verify the installation was successful, run `ygdrassil status` and execute a remote execution job against the host using the script provider job.

. To register your host with the pull client configuration option enabled, navigate to the advanced fields of the *Global Registration Form* and set `REX pull mode` to `Yes`.
If you make no changes and leave the field on default, the value remains `host_registration_remote_execution_pull parameter`.

. Set the `enable-remote-execution-pull` parameter to `true` so the script from `katello-pull-transport-migrate` is put on the disk and executed during provisioning.

// Start this list from 6.
[start=6]
. To verify the installation was successful, run
----
ygdrassil status
----
// Start this list from 7.
[start=7]
. Execute a remote execution job against the host using the script provider job.
