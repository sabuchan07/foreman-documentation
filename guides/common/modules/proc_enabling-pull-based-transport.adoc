= Enabling Pull-based Transport

.Procedure
If your {Project} or {SmartProxy} is preinstalled, enable the pull provider using:
ifdef::satellite[]
`satellite-installer --foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-script-mode=pull-mqtt`
endif::[]
`foreman-installer --foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-script-mode=pull-mqtt`.

You may additionally need to run `--foreman-proxy-templates=true --foreman-proxy-registration=true` to enable the {SmartProxy} for host registration.

When the installer command succeeds, the MQTT broker runs at Port 1883.
You must allow that port in your firewall by running the following commands:

. `firewall-cmd --add-port="1883/tcp"`
. `firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent`

Choose one of three options to enable hosts to work with MQTT for pull provider:

* Migrate existing clients to pull provider

ifdef::satellite[]
If your client is already registered to {Project}, you can convert the client to the pull-based transport if the client has access to the {Project} Client repository.

Do this by following these steps:
.Install the conversion tool by running `yum install katello-pull-transport-migrate`, which installs `foreman_ygg_worker` and `yggdrasil` as dependencies and performs the conversion.
.To verify the installation was successful, run `ygdrassil status` and execute a remote execution job against the host using the script provider job.
endif::[]

* Register clients to pull the provider {SmartProxy}:
In the *Hosts* > *Register host* > *Advanced* tab, if the *REX pull mode* is set to *Yes*, the pull provider client is set up during host registration.

* Provision clients to connect to pull provider:
If you set the `enable-remote-execute-pullâ€™ parameter to `true`, the pull provider client is set up during host registration.
