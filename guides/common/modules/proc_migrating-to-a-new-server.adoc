= Migrating to a New Server

.Prerequisites
* Install a minimal {RHEL} 8 instance on the target machine with the capacity to store backup files.
* Do not install any {RHEL} 8 software groups or third-party applications.

For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/performing_a_standard_rhel_installation/index[Performing a standard {RHEL} installation].

== Creating a backup of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on {RHEL} 7

Before you perform a fresh installation of the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on the {RHEL} 8 system, back up your {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} data on the {RHEL} 7 system by creating an offline backup.

If you recently created an offline backup, you can perform an incremental backup to update the existing backup.

.Procedure
* Perform an offline or incremental backup on the source machine:
** To perform an offline backup, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.10/html/administering_red_hat_satellite/backing-up-satellite-server-and-capsule-server#performing-a-full-backup-of-satellite-or-capsule_admin[Performing a Full Backup of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer}].
** To perform an incremental backup, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.10/html/administering_red_hat_satellite/backing-up-satellite-server-and-capsule-server#performing-an-incremental-backup_admin[Performing an Incremental Backup].
* Transfer the backup to the target machine.

== Performing a fresh installation of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} to migrate to {RHEL} 8

The fresh installation method has three steps:

. Create a backup of the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on the {RHEL} 7 system source machine.
. Perform a fresh installation of the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on a minimal {RHEL} 8 instance on the target machine.
. Restore the backup on the {RHEL} 8 instance.

== Performing a fresh installation of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on {RHEL} 8

After you have created a backup of the {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on the {RHEL} 7 source machine, you can install {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on the {RHEL} 8 target machine.

* To install {ProjectServer}, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.10/html/installing_satellite_server_from_a_connected_network/index[Installing {ProjectServer} from a Connected Network].
* To install {SmartProxyServer}, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.10/html/installing_capsule_server/index[Installing {SmartProxyServer}].


== Restoring a backup of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on {RHEL} 8

After you perform a fresh installation of {ProjectServer} or {SmartProxyServer} on the {RHEL} 8 instance of the target machine, you can restore the backup you previously created.

*Procedure*

* Restore an offline or incremental backup on the target machine:
** To restore an offline backup, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.10/html/administering_red_hat_satellite/sect-administering-backup_and_disaster_recovery-restoring_satellite_server_or_capsule_server_from_a_backup#restoring-from-a-full-backup_admin[Restoring from a Full Backup].
** To restore an incremental backup, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.10/html/administering_red_hat_satellite/sect-administering-backup_and_disaster_recovery-restoring_satellite_server_or_capsule_server_from_a_backup#restoring-from-incremental-backups_admin[Restoring from Incremental Backups].
* Update your network configuration to match the target serverâ€™s IP address and new host name.
