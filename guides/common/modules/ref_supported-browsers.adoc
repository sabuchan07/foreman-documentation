Using the most recent version of a major browser is highly recommended, as {Project} and the frameworks it uses offer limited support for older versions.

The recommended requirements are as follows for major browsers:

* Google Chrome - latest version
* Microsoft Edge - latest version
* Apple Safari - latest version
* Mozilla Firefox - latest version
* Mozilla Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) - latest version

Other browsers may work unpredictably.
