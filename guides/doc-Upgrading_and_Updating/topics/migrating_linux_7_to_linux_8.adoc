= Migrating from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8

{ProjectName} is supported on both Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 and RHEL 8.

Subsequent minor versions of {Project} might be supported on RHEL 8 only.

If you have {ProjectName} running on RHEL 7, you must migrate to RHEL 8 to stay up-to-date on minor releases.

There are two ways to migrate your server to RHEL 8:

//.Unordered list

* Create a backup of your server on RHEL 7, perform a fresh install of a minimal RHEL 8 instance, and restore the backup on the RHEL 8 instance, or
* Perform an in-place migration on your server using the Leapp utility.

=== Fresh Install Method

//.Unordered list

* The fresh install migration method allows you to create a RHEL 8 system with identical specifications and the same hostname as the previous RHEL 7 system.

* You can choose how much of the RHEL 7 system to include in the backup, allowing you to import only relevant parts of the RHEL 7 system to RHEL 8.

* This method requires a considerable amount of system downtime as the RHEL 8 system restores the system backup; to reduce downtime, you can use the RHEL 7 system on the target machine as the backup restores.

NOTE: Any changes you make during this time are not included in the RHEL 8 system backup on the source machine.

//.Unordered list

* You must have storage space for the backup and access to a second machine to host the new RHEL 8 system.

[discrete]
=== In-place Migration Method

//.Unordered list

* The in-place migration method requires less downtime than the fresh install method.

* You do not need storage space for a backup or a second machine for RHEL 8, as the migration can occur in-place on the RHEL 7 machine.

* Unlike with the fresh install method, it is impossible to avoid downtime entirely by using the RHEL 7 system while the RHEL 8 system is prepared, as in-place migration occurs on the same machine.

* In-place migration is not possible with FIPS-enabled systems.
